# TransitTrack

iOS version of [TransitTrack](https://github.com/voxelpushing/TransitTrackAndroid).
TransitTrack does what it says, it tracks transit vehicles. Simply enter the number of the vehicle that you're on, and the app will record vehicle information including:

* Vehicle Route
* Vehicle Number
* Current Time
* Vehicle Direction
* Vehicle Location

All past results are also right at your fingertips for review.

*Note: currently the app only supports vehicle tracking for the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). To test the app, try vehicle numbers 4500, 3411, or 4004.*
